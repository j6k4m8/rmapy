> [!WARNING]
> As far as I can tell, none of the Python reMarkable clients work anymore — this one included. I am working on a new SDK [remarkapy](https://github.com/j6k4m8/remarkapy) which will hopefully take the place of this one.

This is an (unofficial) Remarkable Cloud API Client written in Python.
